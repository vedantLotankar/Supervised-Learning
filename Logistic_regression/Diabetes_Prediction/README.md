# 🏥 Diabetes Prediction Model  

Welcome to the **Diabetes Prediction Model** repository! 🎉 This project is a part of my **Supervised Learning** journey, where I explore different machine learning techniques. For this model, I decided to try something new and built it using **TensorFlow**.  

<br/>

## 🔹 Project Overview  

This model predicts whether a person has diabetes based on various health parameters. The dataset includes features like glucose levels, BMI, age, and more. 

- **Framework Used:** TensorFlow 
- **Model Type:** Neural Network 
- **Dataset:** Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset 
- **Goal:** Achieve high accuracy in predicting diabetes while ensuring model generalization.  

<br/>

## 🛠️ Model Performance  

- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score 
- **Current Performance:** Results will be updated soon! 🚀  

<br/>

## 📈 How to Use  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vedantLotankar/supervised-learning/Logistic-regression/Diabetes_Prediction.git
   ```  
<br/>

## 🚀 Future Improvements  

- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy 
- Testing with different neural network architectures 
- Deployment as a web app for easy accessibility
