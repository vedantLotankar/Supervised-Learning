# 📘 Supervised Learning Repository  

Welcome to my **Supervised Learning** repository! 🎉 Here, I upload all the machine learning models I create under the category of supervised learning.  

<br/>

## 🗂 Current Progress  

### 🔹 **Mumbai Housing Prices Prediction**  
- **Linear Regression Model**:  
  - **R² Score**: 0.5805  
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 0.4195
  - **Status**: Did not fit the dataset properly. 
- **Polynomial Regression Model**:  
  - **R² Score**: 0.9850  
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 0.0150  
  - **Status**: A lot more accurate than the linear model. Decided to go with this model for predicting Mumbai housing prices. 🏡🌏
